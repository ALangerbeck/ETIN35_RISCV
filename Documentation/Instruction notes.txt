LW - load word instruction. Adds rs1 + immediate for memory address, then sends it to mem stage. It has a rd, for the register to write the
read value to. 
SW - store word instruction. Adds rs1 + immediate for memory address, then stores value at rs2 at that address. 

Note over data hazards:

The code only checks data hazards in a rudamentory way right now. It checks for the cases when it has a branch instruction and needs to wait
because one or both of the register sources is being computed, that one should not create unnecessary stalls. 
The second type checks whether we have a load instruction in the execution stage and wheteher what we need to load is going to be needed for
the current instruction. If it is we will stall for one clock cycle. This one could make us stall one unnecessary clock cycle by us checking
both rs1 and rs2 when we do not need them for our current instruction and therefore stalling when not needed. To remedy that one has to
check the opcode of the current instruction in more detail and I am not sure that implementation is worth the time to fix. 

Questions: 

For unsigned operations. If the signed number is -7, should the unsigned number be 7 or the value the unsigned number of the two complements
value of -7. After readig it seems like the second option is the one that should be implemented, but it might be best to ask. 

For the shift addi instructions is the shamt(5) meant to be the fifth bit or the sixth bit, is unclear as usually it is written as bit 11-0
when you have 12 bits, but sometimes, it is written 12-1.
